---+!! Test Bootstrap Plugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

This plugin runs the new Bootstrap code developed for Foswiki 1.2.  It
generates a report describing the settings that this feature will generate.

The Bootstrap code allows foswiki to run in a minimal configuration without
a =LocalSite.cfg= file.  However it is very dependent upon the environment
variables and perl capabilites of discovering the system paths.

This report will help us make sure foswiki runs "out of the box" on the widest
variety of systems.  This plugin has no settings or preferences and implements
a single BOOTSTRAP macro which reports what would have been auto configured
had this been a 1.2 system running without LocalSite.cfg

Please send the following bootstrap report to the foswiki developers:
*This report is only available to administrators*
